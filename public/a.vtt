00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.040
When I was lying there in the VA hospital,

2
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.120
with a big hole blown through the middle of my life

3
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.420
I started having these dreams of flying.

4
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.250
I was free.

5
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.050
Sooner or later, though, you always have to wake up.

6
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.770
They can fix a spinal, if you got the money,

7
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.610
but not on vet benefits, not in this economy.

8
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.820
A VA check and 12 bucks will get you a cup of coffee.

9
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.660
I'm what they call... waitlisted.

10
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.210
The Bengal Tiger, extinct for over a century is making a comeback.

11
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.550
These cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo are the latest of a number of species

12
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.470
that have been cloned back into existence in the past five years.

13
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.310
I became a marine for the hardship.

14
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.770
To be hammered on the anvil of life.

15
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.480
I told myself I can pass any test a man can pass.

16
00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.820
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

17
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.120
Oh!

18
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.660
Let's get it straight, upfront.

19
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.160
I don't want your pity.

20
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.420
You want a fair deal, you're on the wrong planet.

21
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.840
The strong prey on the weak.

22
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.260
That's just the way things are.

23
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.640
And nobody does a damn thing.

24
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.160
Get off! Get off of him!

25
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.410
All I ever wanted in my sorry-ass life was a single thing worth fighting for.

26
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.600
I hope you realized you just lost yourself a customer.

27
00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.350
Candy-ass bitch.

28
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.730
If it ain't raining, we ain't training.

29
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.790
It doesn't look like him. It's him.

30
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.120
You Jake Sully?

31
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.460
Step off. You're ruining my good mood.

32
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.500
It's about your brother.

33
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.760
We're looking for Sully, T.

34
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.770
In there.

35
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.460
Jesus, Tommy.

36
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.670
The strong prey on the weak.

37
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.920
A guy with a knife took all Tommy would ever be

38
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.590
for the paper in his wallet.

39
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.760
The concern of the suits was touching.

40
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.350
Your brother represented a significant investment.

41
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.890
We'd like to talk to you about taking over his contract.

42
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.940
And since your genome is identical to his,

43
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.440
you could step into his shoes,

44
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.020
so to speak.

45
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.740
It'd be a fresh start on a new world.

46
00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.700
You could do something important. You can make a difference.

47
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.870
And the pay is good.

48
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.500
Very good.

49
00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.630
Tommy was the scientist, not me.

50
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.710
He was the one who wanted to get shot light-years out in space

51
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.090
to find the answers.

52
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.890
Me, I was just another dumb grunt getting sent someplace he was gonna regret.

53
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.840
In cryo, you don't dream at all.

54
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.050
It doesn't feel like six years.

55
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.430
More like a fifth of tequila and an ass-kicking.

56
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.110
Are we there yet?

57
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.450
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

58
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.370
We're there.

59
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.620
You've been in cryo for five years, nine months and 22 days.

60
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.500
You will be hungry. You will be weak.

61
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.670
If you feel nausea, please use the sacks provided for your convenience.

62
00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.970
The staff thanks you in advance.

63
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.650
Up ahead was Pandora.

64
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.990
You grew up hearing about it, but I never figured I'd be going there.

65
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.760
Valkyrie 1-6, copy...

66
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.600
Valkyrie 1-6, you are clear for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.

67
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.180
Copy, Venture Star. Go for de-orbit burn at 2-2-4-niner.

68
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.040
Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on!

69
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.660
Exo-packs on! Let's go!

70
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.080
Remember, people, you lose that mask,

71
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.880
you're unconscious in 20 seconds, you're dead in four minutes!

72
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.420
Let's nobody be dead today!

73
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.260
Looks very bad on my report.

74
00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.720
Hell's Gate tower, this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

75
00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.600
Crossing outer marker. Mine is in sight.

76
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.390
Harnesses off! Get your packs!

77
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:45.940
- Put it together, let's go! Let's go! - Harnesses off! One minute!

78
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.980
When that ramp comes down, go directly into the base. Do not stop!

79
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.610
Go straight inside. Wait for my mark!

80
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.990
Go, go, go, go! Get out of there! Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!

81
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.170
There's no such thing as an ex-Marine.

82
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.260
You may be out, but you never lose the attitude.

83
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.820
Let's go, special case! Do not make me wait for you!

84
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.650
Well, well, ladies.

85
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.820
Look at all this fresh meat! Whoo!

86
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.830
Back on Earth, these guys were Army dogs, Marines,

87
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.460
fighting for freedom.

88
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.670
Look out, hot rod!

89
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:01.010
But out here they're just hired guns,

90
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.970
taking the money, working for the company.

91
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.430
Check this out, man.

92
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.520
Meals on wheels.

93
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.730
Oh, man, that is just wrong.

94
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.690
I got two guys free in about 20 minutes!

95
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.320
Got it! Need them!

96
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.870
You're not in Kansas anymore.

97
00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:33.210
You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen.

98
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:37.050
Respect that fact every second of every day.

99
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.930
If there is a hell,

100
00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.970
you might want to go there for some R&R

101
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.310
after a tour on Pandora.

102
00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:49.310
Out there, beyond that fence,

103
00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:53.730
every living thing that crawls, flies or squats in the mud

104
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:56.980
wants to kill you and eat your eyes for Jujubes.

105
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.660
We have an indigenous population of humanoids called the Na'vi.

106
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.080
They're fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin

107
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.950
that'll stop your heart in one minute.

108
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.380
And they have bones reinforced with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

109
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.840
They are very hard to kill.

110
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:21.300
As head of security, it is my job to keep you alive.

111
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.010
I will not succeed.

112
00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:28.600
Not with all of you.

113
00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.230
If you wish to survive,

114
00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:34.690
you need to cultivate a strong mental attitude.

115
00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.690
You've got to obey the rules.

116
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.490
Pandora rules.

117
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.450
Rule number one...

118
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:45.200
There's nothing like an old-school safety brief

119
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.990
to put your mind at ease.

120
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.830
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake!

121
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:54.870
You're Jake, right? Tom's brother.

122
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.790
Wow! You look just like him.

123
00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.880
Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman.

124
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.460
I went through avatar training with him.

125
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.720
...into the bio-lab.

126
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:05.970
We're gonna spend a lot of time up here.

127
00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:08.970
Hey! How you doing? Norm, avatar driver.

128
00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.310
- Hi. - Hey.

129
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.980
Link... Here's the link room right here.

130
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.350
This is where we're connecting to the avatar.

131
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.230
Me and Norm are here to drive

132
00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:21.480
these remotely controlled bodies called avatars.

133
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:26.570
And they're grown from human DNA mixed with the DNA of the natives.

134
00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.620
Hey. Welcome. Hey.

135
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.330
Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.

136
00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:31.490
Thanks.

137
00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.960
Damn! They got big.

138
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.580
Yeah, they fully mature on the flight out.

139
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.000
So the proprioceptive sims seem to work really well.

140
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:41.960
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.

141
00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:43.920
It'll take us a few hours to get them decanted,

142
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.930
but you guys can take them out tomorrow.

143
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:47.800
There's yours.

144
00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.100
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

145
00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:54.060
- Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you. - Good to meet you, yeah.

146
00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.460
Looks like him.

147
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.550
No, it looks like you.

148
00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:25.590
This is your avatar now, Jake.

149
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:33.220
And the concept is that every driver is matched to his own avatar,

150
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:37.060
so that their nervous systems are in tune,

151
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.940
or something.

152
00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:42.770
Which is why they offered me the gig,

153
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.690
because I can link with Tommy's avatar,

154
00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.610
which is insanely expensive.

155
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.820
Is this right? I just say whatever to the video log?

156
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.080
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit of documenting everything.

157
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.200
You know, what we see, what we feel.

158
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:57.370
It's all part of the science.

159
00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.000
And good science is good observation.

160
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.500
Plus it'll help to keep you sane for the next six years.

161
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.380
All right. Whatever.

162
00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.010
So, uh...

163
00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:10.510
Well, here I am,

164
00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.680
doing science.

165
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.350
They're coming out!

166
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:18.890
Attention. Drivers coming out of link.

167
00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:27.690
Oh, God.

168
00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.320
Where's the lab coat? Where's the lab coat?

169
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.120
Who's got my goddamn cigarette?

170
00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.750
Guys! What's wrong with this picture?

171
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.160
Thank you!

172
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.290
Grace Augustine is a legend.

173
00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:44.880
She's the head of the Avatar Program. She wrote the book,

174
00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.710
I mean, literally wrote the book on Pandoran botany.

175
00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.050
Well, that's 'cause she likes plants better than people.

176
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.430
Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.

177
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.220
Grace, I'd like you to meet Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

178
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.690
Norm. I hear good things about you. How's your Na'vi?

179
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.980
May the All Mother...

180
00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.150
...smile upon our first meeting.

181
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.400
Not bad. You sound a little formal.

182
00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.870
I studied for five years...

183
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.950
...but there is much to learn.

184
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.660
Grace? This is Jake Sully.

185
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.790
Ma'am.

186
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.830
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are,

187
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.250
and I don't need you. I need your brother.

188
00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.960
You know, the PhD who trained for three years for this mission?

189
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.460
He's dead.

190
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.050
I know it's a big inconvenience for everyone.

191
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.260
How much lab training have you had?

192
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.930
I dissected a frog once.

193
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:41.520
You see? You see? I mean, they're just pissing on us

194
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.770
without even the courtesy of calling it rain.

195
00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.270
I'm going to Selfridge. No, Grace,

196
00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.980
I don't think that's a good idea. No, man, this is such bullshit!

197
00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:49.480
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

198
00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:52.110
He has no business sticking his nose in my department.

199
00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:57.280
Here tomorrow, 0800. Try and use big words.

200
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.840
Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower.

201
00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.460
You are cleared for south departure.

202
00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:12.380
Hover taxi, Delta runway. Squawk ident.

203
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:19.470
Mmm! You see that? Yes, sir.

204
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.640
No, you didn't. You were looking at the monitor.

205
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.640
I love this putter, Ronnie! I love this putter.

206
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.780
Parker, you know, I used to think it was benign neglect,

207
00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.820
but now I see that you're intentionally screwing me.

208
00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.450
Grace, you know, I enjoy our little talks.

209
00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.160
Oops.

210
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.290
I need a researcher. Not some jarhead dropout.

211
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.000
Well, actually, I thought we got lucky with him.

212
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.630
Lucky? Yeah.

213
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:51.710
How is this in any way lucky?

214
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.550
Lucky your guy had a twin brother,

215
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:56.550
and lucky that brother wasn't some oral hygienist or something.

216
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:58.550
A Marine we can use.

217
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.510
I'm assigning him to your team as security escort.

218
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.020
The last thing I need is another trigger-happy moron out there!

219
00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.020
Look, look, you're supposed to be winning the hearts

220
00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.150
and the minds of the natives.

221
00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.060
Isn't that the whole point of your little puppet show?

222
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.650
If you look like them and you talk like them,

223
00:17:10.690 --> 00:17:12.400
then they'll start trusting us.

224
00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.490
We build them a school, we teach them English,

225
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.570
but after, what, how many years?

226
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.200
Relations with the indigenous are only getting worse.

227
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.320
Yeah, that tends to happen

228
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:20.740
when you use machine guns on them.

229
00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:23.700
Right. Come here.

230
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.540
I can't... I can't...

231
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.750
This is why we're here. Unobtanium.

232
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.920
Because this little gray rock sells for 20 million a kilo.

233
00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:39.220
That's the only reason. It's what pays for the whole party.

234
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.220
It's what pays for your science.

235
00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.560
Comprendo?

236
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.730
Now, those savages are threatening our whole operation,

237
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.060
we're on the brink of war,

238
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.350
and you're supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution.

239
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.940
So use what you've got, and get me some results.

240
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.370
So, how much link time have you logged?

241
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:09.790
About 520 hours.

242
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.920
That's good.

243
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.920
You're in there. You're here.

244
00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.510
How much have you logged?

245
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:17.840
Zip. But I read a manual.

246
00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.260
Tell me you're joking.

247
00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.600
This is cool.

248
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:25.680
Let's go.

249
00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.480
Don't. I got this.

250
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.900
So you just figured you'd come out here,

251
00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:41.110
to the most hostile environment known to man,

252
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.620
with no training of any kind, and see how it went?

253
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.370
What was going through your head?

254
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.290
Maybe I was sick of doctors telling me what I couldn't do.

255
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.630
Biometrics are good.

256
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:53.750
Link three is ready.

257
00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:55.880
Keep your arms in, hands in,

258
00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:58.460
head down.

259
00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:03.300
Down. Just relax and let your mind go blank.

260
00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.470
That shouldn't be hard for you.

261
00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.810
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white...

262
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:09.350
Initiate link.

263
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.650
Run sequence unit three. Go.

264
00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.110
Launching.

265
00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.070
I have the first congruency.

266
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.040
That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.

267
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.630
Hmm. Go figure.

268
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.040
Phase-lock 40%.

269
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.590
All right. Going in.

270
00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:44.800
I'm going in in four.

271
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:50.470
Phase-lock 99%. Link is stable.

272
00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:09.200
He's in. Jake, can you hear me?

273
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.200
Can you hear me, Jake?

274
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.870
Pupillary reflex is good.

275
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.040
Pinna response normal. How you feeling, Jake?

276
00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.760
Hey, guys.

277
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:22.800
Welcome to your new body, Jake.

278
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.840
Good!

279
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.390
Yeah, we're gonna take this nice and easy, Jake.

280
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:28.600
And touch your thumb to your fingers. Yeah.

281
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.060
Thumb to your fingers. No problem.

282
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:31.720
That's good. I can see you can remember that one.

283
00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:32.850
Got it.

284
00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:33.980
Well, if you want to sit up,

285
00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.350
that's fine. Okay, good. Just take it

286
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.560
nice and slow, Jake. Good.

287
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:38.400
Okay, well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.

288
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.270
Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all?

289
00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.980
You're wiggling your toes!

290
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.820
Good. Good, Jake. That's great.

291
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.410
Distal motor control is good. Good, Jake.

292
00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:51.160
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

293
00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.000
- That's great, Jake. Hold on, now. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.

294
00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.120
Take it easy. Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

295
00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:58.750
There's a few more sensory motor reflex tests we need to run,

296
00:20:58.790 --> 00:20:59.790
so take it easy.

297
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.920
Ooh! Wait.

298
00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.460
Jake. Sit down, Jake.

299
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:04.880
Jake! Listen to me. Jake! Whoa.

300
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.260
I need you to sit down. Jake! It's okay.

301
00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.140
Buddy, listen to me. It's all good. I got this.

302
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:11.390
Jake, you need to sit down right now.

303
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:12.890
Guys, get him back on the gurney now.

304
00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.100
Listen to me. For your own safety, you need to sit down.

305
00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.980
You need time to adjust to the avatar... Whoa! Jake!

306
00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.110
God, Jake, watch your tail.

307
00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.190
Yeah!

308
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.490
Sedate! Sedate him! A thousand milligrams of Supitocam! Stat!

309
00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.860
Guys! Guys! Whoa! Whoa!

310
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:27.950
By the numbers.

311
00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.450
Jake. Come on. Jake! Listen to me.

312
00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.120
You're not used to your avatar body.

313
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.910
This is dangerous. This is great.

314
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.250
Jake? Jake, listen to me. Come on. They're gonna put you out.

315
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:39.960
Norm, sit down.

316
00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.460
No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.

317
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.130
God damn it! Bring them home!

318
00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.340
Norm! Do not leave control!

319
00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.880
You're not ready for it!

320
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:50.010
Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills.

321
00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.470
Ooh! Ooh! So close!

322
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.140
I don't even have to play defense on it.

323
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.720
- Hey, guys. Hey. - Whoa.

324
00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.020
It's okay, I'll get him.

325
00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.140
Jake, you have to come back!

326
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:58.980
Jake! Jake! Excuse me.

327
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:03.150
Watch it! Sorry!

328
00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:04.650
Come on!

329
00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.650
Jake! We're not supposed to be running!

330
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.460
Jeez! Sorry.

331
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.580
Watch it!

332
00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.360
Hey, Marine!

333
00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:46.610
Damn.

334
00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:49.860
Grace?

335
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:51.820
Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?

336
00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:54.580
Think fast.

337
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:57.580
Motor control's looking good.

338
00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.550
Come on, everybody, quiet down!

339
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.800
All right, gang, lights out.

340
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:14.010
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.

341
00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:15.550
Hey, hey, hey!

342
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.270
Don't play with that, you'll go blind.

343
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:19.850
That's kind of freaky.

344
00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:22.060
Come on. Scat.

345
00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:24.560
Good night.

346
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.570
Lights out! See you at dinner, kiddies.

347
00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:54.590
Welcome back.

348
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.640
You okay? You all right?

349
00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:04.940
Yeah, I'm okay.

350
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:11.940
I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties. And this here is my baby.

351
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:14.160
Hold on a second.

352
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.620
Hey, Wainfleet! Get it done!

353
00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.290
We bounce at zero-nine.

354
00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.160
Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!

355
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:24.830
Vine strike's still loose.

356
00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.130
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

357
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.540
Watch it!

358
00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:31.840
Yeah, that's 'cause we're not the only thing flying around out there.

359
00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.630
Or the biggest.

360
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.510
I'm gonna need you on a door gun. I'm a man short.

361
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.430
I thought you'd never ask.

362
00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:42.930
There's your man. See you on the flight line.

363
00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:56.030
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

364
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:58.740
This low gravity'll make you soft.

365
00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.700
You get soft,

366
00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.250
Pandora will shit you out dead with zero warning.

367
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.880
I pulled your record, Corporal.

368
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.380
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

369
00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:18.680
Nothing like this here, though.

370
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:22.100
You got some heart, kid,

371
00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.470
showing up in this neighborhood.

372
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.270
I figured it's just another hellhole.

373
00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.770
I was First Recon myself.

374
00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.070
A few years ahead of you. Well, maybe more than a few.

375
00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:35.950
Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.

376
00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.490
I come out here?

377
00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.530
Day one. Think I felt like a shavetail louie?

378
00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:46.210
Yeah. Oh, they could fix me up, if I rotated back.

379
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:49.170
Yeah, and make me pretty again.

380
00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:51.960
But you know what? I kind of like it.

381
00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:54.880
It reminds me every day what's waiting out there.

382
00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.880
Hup! The Avatar Program is a bad joke.

383
00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:02.810
Bunch of limp-dick science majors.

384
00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:09.850
However, it does present an opportunity both timely and unique.

385
00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.560
- Clear! - Clear!

386
00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:21.910
A recon gyrene in an avatar body. That's a potent mix.

387
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:23.620
Give me the goose bumps.

388
00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:27.120
Such a Marine could provide the intel I need,

389
00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:28.910
right on the ground.

390
00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:31.580
Right in the hostiles' camp.

391
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:38.260
Look, Sully. I want you to learn these savages from the inside.

392
00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.050
I want you to gain their trust.

393
00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:41.890
I need to know how to force their cooperation

394
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:44.470
or hammer them hard if they won't.

395
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:47.060
Am I still with Augustine?

396
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.230
On paper.

397
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:52.440
Yeah, you walk like one of her science pukes, you quack like one,

398
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.520
but you report to me.

399
00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:57.940
Can you do that for me, son?

400
00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:01.660
Hell, yeah, sir.

401
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.370
Well, all right, then.

402
00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.300
Son, I take care of my own.

403
00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.470
You get me what I need,

404
00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:22.340
I'll see to it you get your legs back when you rotate home.

405
00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.180
Your real legs.

406
00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:29.980
That sounds real good, sir.

407
00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:37.980
Link's ready!

408
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:39.320
Phase-lock 40%.

409
00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:43.030
Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the talking.

410
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:46.660
I have five congruencies. Phase-lock 90%.

411
00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.080
Link three ready.

412
00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.410
All right, I'm going in.

413
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.570
Sturmbeest herd coming up on your right.

414
00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.450
Got it! Thanks.

415
00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:31.040
Looks like a bull, a dozen cows and some juveniles.

416
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:21.500
Shut it down. We're gonna stay a while.

417
00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:27.180
Norm! Your pack.

418
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.760
Pack.

419
00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:34.810
Stay with the ship. One idiot with a gun is enough.

420
00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:39.480
You the man, Doc.

421
00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:19.190
Prolemuris. They're not aggressive.

422
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:25.230
Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.

423
00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.410
So, how will they know we're here?

424
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:36.160
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

425
00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:42.250
This was our school.

426
00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:45.590
Now it's just... storage.

427
00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.340
The kids were so bright.

428
00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.260
Eager to learn.

429
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:52.840
They picked up English faster than I could teach it.

430
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:57.270
So, we'll take a couple of these Ph monitors...

431
00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.480
...and a soil probe.

432
00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:03.400
That little yellow case back there. The old microscope.

433
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.150
Here.

434
00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.820
Oh, yeah. I love this one.

435
00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.030
The stingbats knocked them down.

436
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.330
I keep hoping someone will come back in and read them.

437
00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:24.130
Why don't they come back?

438
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:32.220
The Omaticaya... learned as much about us as they needed to.

439
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:38.560
What happened here?

440
00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.520
Are you going to help us with this gear? We've got a lot to do.

441
00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.080
Keep moving, Norm. Keep up, guys!

442
00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.090
And here I go. Scanning.

443
00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:13.680
Oh, wow! It's that fast?

444
00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.010
Amazing, isn't it? Yeah.

445
00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:21.890
So, that is signal transduction from this root

446
00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:25.600
to the root of the tree next to it. So, we should take a sample.

447
00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:27.360
Okay. Sample.

448
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.190
You know, it's probably electrical,

449
00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.700
based on the speed of the reaction.

450
00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:38.330
Norm, you've contaminated the sample with your saliva.

451
00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.580
Right.

452
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.360
So, here I go.

453
00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:39.260
Don't shoot. Don't shoot, you'll piss him off.

454
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:44.890
It's already pissed off.

455
00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:46.850
Jake, that armor's too thick.

456
00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:47.980
Trust me.

457
00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.400
It's a territorial threat display.

458
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:57.950
Do not run, or he'll charge.

459
00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.370
So, what do I do, dance with it?

460
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:03.290
Just hold your ground.

461
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:21.390
Yeah? Come on! What you got?

462
00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.470
Oh, yeah. Who's bad? That's right.

463
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.890
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, bitch.

464
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.480
That's right, get your punk ass back to mommy.

465
00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:35.030
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing. You keep running.

466
00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:37.400
Yeah, and why don't you bring back some of your friends, huh?

467
00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.320
Oh, shit.

468
00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:56.630
So what about this one? Run? Don't run? What?

469
00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:00.090
Run! Definitely run!

470
00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:47.860
I'm gonna have to call it, guys.

471
00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:50.820
We're not allowed to run night ops. Colonel's orders.

472
00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:55.030
I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have to hang on till morning.

473
00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:57.500
He won't make it till morning.

474
00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.360
I don't have all goddamn night.

475
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:55.320
Come on! Come on!

476
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:10.900
Hey, wait. Don't!

477
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.530
Great.

478
00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.550
Look, I know you probably don't understand this,

479
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.850
But thank you.

480
00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:30.230
Thank you.

481
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.900
That was pretty impressive.

482
00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:41.570
I would have been screwed if you hadn't come along. It was...

483
00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.240
Hey, wait a second. Hey, where you going?

484
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:50.710
Wait up!

485
00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.250
Just... Hey, slow down.

486
00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:56.090
Look, wait up, I just wanted to say thanks for killing those things.

487
00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.630
Damn!

488
00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:00.510
Don't thank.

489
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:03.800
You don't thank for this.

490
00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:09.310
This is sad. Very sad only.

491
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:12.350
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

492
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:14.980
Whatever I did, I am sorry.

493
00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:21.650
All this is your fault. They did not need to die.

494
00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:24.570
My fault? They attacked me. How am I the bad guy?

495
00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:25.740
Your fault!

496
00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:26.820
Whoa!

497
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:28.200
Your fault!

498
00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.540
Shh. Easy. Easy.

499
00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:33.290
You're like a baby. Making noise, don't know what to do.

500
00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:37.040
Easy. Shh.

501
00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:39.500
Fine. Fine.

502
00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:42.800
If you love your little forest friends,

503
00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:46.220
why not let them just kill my ass?

504
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.970
What's the thinking?

505
00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:50.770
Why save you?

506
00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:52.480
Yeah. Yeah, why save me?

507
00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.900
You have a strong heart.

508
00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:02.240
No fear.

509
00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:09.580
But stupid! Ignorant like a child.

510
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.420
Well, if I'm like a child, then...

511
00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:21.300
Look, maybe you should teach me.

512
00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:23.590
Sky People cannot learn. You do not See.

513
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:25.550
Well, then teach me how to See.

514
00:45:25.590 --> 00:45:27.260
No one can teach you to See.

515
00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.340
Whoa.

516
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:31.930
Look, come on, can't we talk?

517
00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:34.810
Say, where'd you learn to speak English?

518
00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:36.770
Dr. Augustine's school?

519
00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:42.440
You're like a baby.

520
00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.280
You're like a baby.

521
00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:51.120
I need your help.

522
00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.040
You should not be here.

523
00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:55.960
Okay, take me with you.

524
00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.790
No! Go back.

525
00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.040
No.

526
00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:04.260
Go back.

527
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:26.900
No!

528
00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:49.930
What...

529
00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:55.180
What are they?

530
00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.520
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

531
00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.230
Very pure spirits.

532
00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:04.980
Uh-huh.

533
00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:26.500
What was that all about?

534
00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:30.510
Come.

535
00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:33.050
Come!

536
00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:36.560
Where are we going?

537
00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:48.150
Come.

538
00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:05.040
What's your name?

539
00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:06.130
Shit!

540
00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:32.820
Okay.

541
00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:38.410
Calm people, calm.

542
00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:47.000
What are you doing, Tsu'tey?

543
00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.380
These demons are forbidden here.

544
00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:55.510
There has been a sign.

545
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:57.850
This is a matter for the Tsahik.

546
00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:03.680
Bring him.

547
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:06.190
What's going on?

548
00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:10.230
Wait.

549
00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.820
What's happening?

550
00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:16.570
Hey!

551
00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:28.230
Father...

552
00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:30.860
...I see you.

553
00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:43.990
This creature…

554
00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:47.370
...why do you bring him here?

555
00:50:48.830 --> 00:50:50.210
I was going to kill him...

556
00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:52.330
...but there was a sing from Eywa.

557
00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.590
I have said...

558
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:57.260
...no dreamwalker will come here.

559
00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:58.590
What's he saying?

560
00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:01.510
His alien smell fills my nose.

561
00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:02.470
Hey, what's he saying?

562
00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.350
My father is deciding whether to kill you.

563
00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:09.520
Your father. It's nice to meet you, sir.

564
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:14.690
Step back!

565
00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:20.240
I will look at this alien.

566
00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.610
That is Mother.

567
00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:25.620
She is Tsahik. The one who interprets the will of Eywa.

568
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:27.830
Who's Eywa?

569
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:36.420
What are you called?

570
00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:38.710
Jake Sully.

571
00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.520
Why did you come to us?

572
00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:51.730
I came to learn.

573
00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:55.770
We have tried to teach other Sky People.

574
00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:59.240
It is hard to fill a cup which is already full.

575
00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:03.030
Well, my cup is empty, trust me.

576
00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:06.910
Just ask Dr. Augustine. I'm no scientist.

577
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:08.450
What are you?

578
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:13.920
I was a Marine. A...

579
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:17.920
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

580
00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:19.260
A warrior!

581
00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:20.840
I could kill him easily!

582
00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.130
I could kill him easily! No!

583
00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:26.760
This is the first warrior dreamwalker...

584
00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:28.720
...we have seen.

585
00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:31.600
We need to learn more about him.

586
00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.980
My Daughter...

587
00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:40.360
...you will teach him our way...

588
00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:43.820
...to speak and walk as we do.

589
00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:47.450
Why me? That's not fair...

590
00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:52.330
It is decided. My daughter will teach you our ways.

591
00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:56.000
Learn well, Jakesully.

592
00:52:56.790 --> 00:53:00.630
Then we will see if your insanity can be cured.

593
00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:20.820
Good evening.

594
00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:25.610
Please don't get up.

595
00:53:27.490 --> 00:53:28.820
Excuse me.

596
00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.240
Sorry.

597
00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:37.120
Hey, how you doing?

598
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:46.720
Thank you.

599
00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:51.600
You know, I don't even know your name.

600
00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:54.730
Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.

601
00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:58.940
Again, a whole lot slower?

602
00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:00.270
Neytiri.

603
00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:01.980
Neytili.

604
00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:04.280
Neytiri.

605
00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:06.650
Neytiri.

606
00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:09.660
It's nice to meet you, Neytiri.

607
00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.530
It's nice.

608
00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:56.620
Jake. Jake! He's in alpha.

609
00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:59.040
He's coming out right now.

610
00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:00.250
Jake. Jake!

611
00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:04.380
Come on back, kid. Come on. That's it.

612
00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:08.970
There you go. There you go, there you go.

613
00:55:09.050 --> 00:55:11.430
You're okay. You're okay.

614
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:14.140
Damn! You were dug in like a tick.

615
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.140
Is the avatar safe?

616
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:20.270
Yeah, Doc.

617
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:23.360
And you are not gonna believe where I am.

618
00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:27.940
The last thing we see is this Marine's ass

619
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:32.070
disappearing into the brush with this angry thanator coming after him.

620
00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:33.700
Hey, it's not something you can teach.

621
00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:35.120
That is awesome.

622
00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:37.540
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,

623
00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:40.540
the Omaticaya have chosen you. God help us all.

624
00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:43.420
"Jarhead clan"?

625
00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.460
Mmm-hmm.

626
00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:46.550
And it worked?

627
00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:48.710
Hey, I'm practically family.

628
00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:52.930
They're gonna study me. I have to learn to be one of them.

629
00:55:52.970 --> 00:55:54.600
That's called taking the initiative, son.

630
00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:55.970
I wish I had 10 more like you.

631
00:55:56.010 --> 00:55:57.180
Look, Sully. Sully.

632
00:55:57.270 --> 00:56:00.680
Just find out what the blue monkeys want.

633
00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:07.230
You know, I mean, we try to give them medicine, education, roads.

634
00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:09.150
But no, no, no, they like mud.

635
00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:13.160
And that wouldn't bother me, it's just that they're...

636
00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:16.830
Hey, can you... Can somebody just... Sector 12.

637
00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:21.750
Okay, go, go, go, stop. Stop...

638
00:56:21.830 --> 00:56:24.000
Rich, stop! That's... Jesus!

639
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:30.170
Their damn village happens to be resting on the richest unobtanium deposit

640
00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:33.010
within 200 klicks in any direction.

641
00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:35.590
I mean, look at all that cheddar!

642
00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:40.810
Well, who gets them to move?

643
00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:41.930
Guess.

644
00:56:43.770 --> 00:56:45.150
What if they won't go?

645
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:47.730
Oh, I'm betting that they will.

646
00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:50.530
Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey. Look. Look.

647
00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:54.200
Killing the indigenous looks bad,

648
00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:58.030
but there's one thing that shareholders hate more than bad press,

649
00:56:58.120 --> 00:56:59.910
and that's a bad quarterly statement.

650
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:01.330
I didn't make up the rules.

651
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:04.580
So just find me a carrot that'll get them to move,

652
00:57:05.330 --> 00:57:08.420
otherwise it's gonna have to be all stick. Okay?

653
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.340
You got three months. That's when the 'dozers get there.

654
00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.800
Well, we're wasting time.

655
00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:16.890
I like this guy.

656
00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:18.050
Guys, right now...

657
00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:20.510
Okay, let's run through them again.

658
00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:22.890
Mo'at. Dragon lady.

659
00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:27.900
Eytucan. Eytukan. He's the clan leader.

660
00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:29.940
But she's the spiritual leader.

661
00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:31.150
Like a shaman.

662
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:32.820
Got it.

663
00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:33.940
T'su'tey.

664
00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:35.110
Tsu'tey.

665
00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:36.240
Tsu'tey.

666
00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.950
He'll be the next clan leader.

667
00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:40.950
Neytiri.

668
00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.410
She'll be the next Tsahik.

669
00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:44.500
They become a mated pair.

670
00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:46.540
So who's this Eywa?

671
00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:47.750
Who's Eywa?

672
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:49.750
Only their deity.

673
00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:53.710
Their goddess, made up of all living things. Everything they know!

674
00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:55.880
You'd know this if you had any training whatsoever.

675
00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:57.300
Who's got a date with the chief's daughter?

676
00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:59.090
Come on. That's not a...

677
00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:01.760
Knock it off. It's like kindergarten around here.

678
00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:06.810
Neytiri was my best student.

679
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:09.900
She and her sister, Sylwanin.

680
00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:12.400
Just amazing girls.

681
00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:14.070
I got a date with Sylwanin too.

682
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:16.030
She's dead.

683
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:22.450
Let's go. Village life starts early.

684
00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:27.160
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

685
00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:47.680
Easy, boy.

686
00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:50.400
Pale is female.

687
00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:55.780
Okay. Easy, girl.

688
00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:28.390
That is shahaylu. The bond.

689
00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:31.730
Feel her.

690
00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:38.990
Feel her heartbeat. Her breath.

691
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:43.780
Feel her strong legs.

692
00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:48.580
You may tell her what to do.

693
00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:49.870
Inside.

694
00:59:50.830 --> 00:59:53.750
For now, say where to go.

695
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:58.000
Forward!

696
01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:17.230
You should go away.

697
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:18.730
No, you'd miss me.

698
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:21.860
I knew you could speak English.

699
01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:27.200
This alien will learn nothing...

700
01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:29.240
...a rock sees more...

701
01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:31.500
...look at him.

702
01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:41.840
Again.

703
01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:43.260
If you want to hit this thing,

704
01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.390
it's gonna be complicated.

705
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:47.930
Your scan doesn't show the internal structure.

706
01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:50.100
- There's an outer row of columns. - Uh-huh.

707
01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:52.930
Real heavy duty. There's a secondary ring here,

708
01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:54.140
and an inner ring.

709
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:56.610
There's a core structure like a spiral.

710
01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.110
That's how they move up and down.

711
01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:02.070
We're gonna need accurate scans on every column.

712
01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:03.110
Roger that.

713
01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:05.780
What else can you tell us about the structure?

714
01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:09.120
I'm guessing this secondary ring, that's also load-bearing.

715
01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:15.750
So where are we going?

716
01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.130
Getting out of Dodge.

717
01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:22.670
I'm not about to let Selfridge and Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

718
01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:26.010
There's a mobile link up at Site 26 we can work out of,

719
01:01:26.090 --> 01:01:28.050
way up in the mountains.

720
01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.430
The Hallelujah Mountains?

721
01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:32.180
That's right.

722
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:33.480
Are you serious?

723
01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.600
Yeah.

724
01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:35.690
Yes!

725
01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:41.440
The legendary floating mountains of Pandora.

726
01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:42.650
Heard of them?

727
01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:58.040
We're getting close.

728
01:01:58.130 --> 01:02:00.040
Yeah, look at my instruments.

729
01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.840
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

730
01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:06.170
We're VFR from here on.

731
01:02:06.220 --> 01:02:08.130
What's VFR?

732
01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:10.550
Means you gotta see where you're going.

733
01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.100
You can't see anything.

734
01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.560
Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

735
01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:35.700
Oh, my God.

736
01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:48.050
You should see your faces.

737
01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.540
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

738
01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:33.260
So what does hold them up?

739
01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:34.800
Grace explained it to me.

740
01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.470
Some kind of maglev effect.

741
01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:41.390
Because unobtanium is a superconductor... or something.

742
01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:05.540
Welcome to camp.

743
01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:12.680
So, this is my bunk.

744
01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.050
This stuff is nasty.

745
01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:17.390
Norm, go under. All right.

746
01:04:17.470 --> 01:04:18.560
Grace didn't miss a thing.

747
01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.980
Trudy, you'll take the top one.

748
01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:23.480
She knew I was talking to the Colonel.

749
01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:27.190
But I had what she needed, a way back in with the clan,

750
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:28.860
so she's playing nice.

751
01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:32.490
All right. Jake, hang a left.

752
01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:34.030
You'll be in the link at the end.

753
01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:41.000
Unit one. Beulah. She's the least glitchy.

754
01:05:30.210 --> 01:05:31.550
Holy shit!

755
01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:33.720
Do not look in her eye.

756
01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:44.600
Lkran is not horse.

757
01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:47.600
Once shahaylu is made,

758
01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:55.820
ikran will fly with only one hunter in the whole life.

759
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:08.500
To become taronyu, hunter,

760
01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:12.170
you must choose your own ikran and he must choose you.

761
01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.760
When? When you are ready.

762
01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:10.310
Okay. This is video log 12.

763
01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.190
Time's 2132.

764
01:07:14.610 --> 01:07:15.860
Do I have to do this now?

765
01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:17.990
I really need to get some rack.

766
01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:20.910
No, now. When it's fresh.

767
01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:25.410
Okay, location, shack,

768
01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:28.710
and the days are starting to blur together.

769
01:07:31.170 --> 01:07:34.040
The language is a pain, but, you know,

770
01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:35.880
I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon.

771
01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.300
Just repetition, repetition.

772
01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:39.010
Navi. "Nari."

773
01:07:39.050 --> 01:07:40.130
Nari.

774
01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:41.340
"Narrri"!

775
01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:42.680
Narrri!

776
01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.640
Txur ni'ul. Stronger.

777
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:53.900
Neytiri calls me skxawng. It means moron.

778
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:57.690
This is a very important part of it.

779
01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:58.820
Norm's attitude has improved lately.

780
01:07:58.900 --> 01:07:59.900
I see you. I see you.

781
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:02.360
But it's not just, "I'm seeing you in front of me,"

782
01:08:02.410 --> 01:08:04.070
it's "I see into you. I See you."

783
01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.200
It's good he's back on board,

784
01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:06.830
but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too.

785
01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:08.080
"I'm accepting you. I understand you."

786
01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:09.160
So you gotta get this, okay?

787
01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.460
I gotta run! Okay? Let's go.

788
01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:16.840
My feet are getting tougher. I can run farther every day.

789
01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:21.840
I have to trust my body to know what to do.

790
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:28.680
Yeah! Check it out!

791
01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.270
Oh, crap!

792
01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:37.480
Every day it's reading the trails,

793
01:08:37.570 --> 01:08:39.900
the tracks at the waterhole,

794
01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:42.200
the tiniest scents and sounds.

795
01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:52.540
She's always going on about the flow of energy, the spirits of animals.

796
01:08:53.290 --> 01:08:56.000
I really hope this tree-hugger crap isn't on the final.

797
01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:59.750
This isn't just about eye-hand coordination out there, you know.

798
01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:02.510
You need to listen to what she says.

799
01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:05.760
Try to see the forest through her eyes.

800
01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.430
Excuse me. This is my video log here.

801
01:09:23.820 --> 01:09:26.410
With Neytiri, it's learn fast or die.

802
01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:29.830
You gotta be kidding me.

803
01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.900
I talked Mo'at into letting Grace into the village.

804
01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:03.650
Look how big you are.

805
01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:04.650
It's the first time since her school was closed down.

806
01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.490
You are so pretty.

807
01:10:35.730 --> 01:10:37.310
Come on, Marine.

808
01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:07.550
I'm trying to understand this deep connection the people have to the forest.

809
01:11:08.010 --> 01:11:10.840
She talks about a network of energy

810
01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:14.260
that flows through all living things.

811
01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:18.480
She says all energy is only borrowed,

812
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:21.980
and one day you have to give it back.

813
01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.520
You were in 16 hours today.

814
01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.400
You're still losing weight.

815
01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:16.580
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, you don't.

816
01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:19.370
I gotta get some sleep. Come back here.

817
01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.040
Bon appétit.

818
01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:26.960
Today I made a kill.

819
01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:30.760
And we ate it. At least, I know where that meal came from.

820
01:12:31.090 --> 01:12:35.260
Other body. You need to take care of this body. Okay?

821
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:37.050
Get it? Let's eat it. Yeah, yeah.

822
01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:40.060
Here. I'll make it easy for you.

823
01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:42.350
Give it to me.

824
01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:43.940
You look like crap. Thank you.

825
01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:45.770
You're burning way too hard.

826
01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:48.690
Get rid of this shit.

827
01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:50.690
And then you can lecture me.

828
01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:54.490
Now, I'm telling you, as your boss,

829
01:12:55.950 --> 01:12:58.080
and as someone who might even consider being a friend someday

830
01:12:59.370 --> 01:13:01.790
To take some down time.

831
01:13:01.870 --> 01:13:03.620
Eat this, please.

832
01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:08.380
Trust me, I... learned the hard way.

833
01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:25.560
What did happen at the school, Grace?

834
01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:39.370
Neytiri's sister, Sylwanin, stopped coming to school.

835
01:13:39.450 --> 01:13:41.490
She was angry about the clear-cutting.

836
01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.870
And one day, she and a couple of other young hunters came running in

837
01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:50.090
all painted up.

838
01:13:50.170 --> 01:13:52.800
They had set a bulldozer on fire.

839
01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:59.010
I guess they thought I could protect them.

840
01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:04.640
The troopers pursued them to the school.

841
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:08.020
They killed Sylwanin in the doorway.

842
01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:10.400
Right in front of Neytiri.

843
01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.650
And then shot the others.

844
01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:15.950
I got most of the kids out.

845
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:21.620
But they never came back.

846
01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:26.460
I'm sorry.

847
01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:38.840
A scientist stays objective.

848
01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:43.560
We can't be ruled by emotion.

849
01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.810
But I put 10 years of my life into that school.

850
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:50.560
They called me sa'nok.

851
01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:53.650
Mother.

852
01:14:53.730 --> 01:14:54.730
Mother.

853
01:14:57.150 --> 01:15:01.570
That kind of pain reaches back through the link.

854
01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:28.140
I see you...

855
01:15:28.230 --> 01:15:29.440
...Brother

856
01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:32.100
...and thank you.

857
01:15:36.230 --> 01:15:38.110
Your spirit goes with Eywa.

858
01:15:38.650 --> 01:15:40.490
Your body stays behind...

859
01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:43.450
...to become part of The People.

860
01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:48.620
A clean kill.

861
01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:53.460
You are ready.

862
01:16:19.110 --> 01:16:22.490
Learning to ride an ikran, we call them banshees,

863
01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:25.160
is the test every young hunter has to pass.

864
01:16:27.370 --> 01:16:30.700
But to do that, you gotta go where the banshees are.

865
01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:32.750
Oo-rah.

866
01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:05.490
Now what?

867
01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.560
Jakesully will go first.

868
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:32.430
Now you choose your ikran. This you must feel inside.

869
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:36.310
If he also chooses you, move quick like I showed.

870
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:39.230
You will have one chance, Jake.

871
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:41.440
How will I know if he chooses me?

872
01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:43.480
He will try to kill you.

873
01:19:44.650 --> 01:19:46.070
Outstanding.

874
01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:47.750
Let's dance.

875
01:20:53.890 --> 01:20:55.760
That moron's going to die.

876
01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:21.580
Don't be afraid, warrior.

877
01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:22.830
Make the bond!

878
01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:27.420
No!

879
01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:32.510
Jake!

880
01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:48.150
Shahaylu, Jake.

881
01:21:50.530 --> 01:21:51.780
Shahaylu!

882
01:22:01.870 --> 01:22:03.000
Stop!

883
01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:16.720
Yeah, that's right. You're mine. Huh?

884
01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:32.900
First flight seals the bond. You cannot wait.

885
01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:35.650
Think, "Fly!"

886
01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:36.740
Fly?

887
01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:46.460
God damn!

888
01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.130
Oh, shit!

889
01:23:01.720 --> 01:23:03.930
Shut up and fly straight!

890
01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:16.320
That's it. Bank left!

891
01:23:25.620 --> 01:23:27.450
Level out! That's it.

892
01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:34.250
Whoo! Jakesully!

893
01:23:59.030 --> 01:24:00.110
Hey!

894
01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.450
Let's go!

895
01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:21.340
Yeah, baby, I got this!

896
01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:23.890
Oh, shit!

897
01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:31.230
I may not be much of a horse guy,

898
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:32.690
but I was born to do this.

899
01:24:32.770 --> 01:24:34.400
Yeah!

900
01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:38.940
I came like this. This you. Yeah, yeah.

901
01:24:39.030 --> 01:24:41.900
I turn. I feel the wind. I turn very strong.

902
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:44.030
Look, yeah, see, I banked so hard...

903
01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:48.100
The Tree of Souls.

904
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:53.680
It's their most sacred place.

905
01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:57.310
See the Flux Vortex in these false color images?

906
01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.480
Yeah, that's what messes up my instruments.

907
01:25:59.570 --> 01:26:04.110
There is something really interesting going on in there biologically.

908
01:26:05.490 --> 01:26:07.570
I would die to get samples.

909
01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:10.990
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

910
01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:12.410
You lucky swine.

911
01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:34.870
Hell, yeah!

912
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:36.500
Hell, yeah!

913
01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:51.680
I was a stone-cold aerial hunter.

914
01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:53.010
Death from above.

915
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:56.010
Only problem is, you're not the only one.

916
01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:02.400
Dive!

917
01:28:25.170 --> 01:28:26.380
Go, go!

918
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:35.890
Follow me!

919
01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:42.600
Whew.

920
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:24.890
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

921
01:29:25.770 --> 01:29:27.060
It is Toruk.

922
01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:28.900
Last Shadow.

923
01:29:30.570 --> 01:29:33.700
Yeah, right. It's the last one you ever see.

924
01:29:38.330 --> 01:29:42.080
My grandfather's grandfather was Toruk Macto.

925
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:44.540
Rider of Last Shadow.

926
01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:47.380
He rode this?

927
01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.630
Toruk chose him.

928
01:29:51.010 --> 01:29:54.840
It has only happened five times since the time of the First Songs.

929
01:29:54.930 --> 01:29:56.090
That's a long time.

930
01:29:56.180 --> 01:29:57.220
Yes.

931
01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:59.510
Toruk Macto was mighty.

932
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:04.140
He brought the clans together in a time of great sorrow.

933
01:30:05.190 --> 01:30:07.520
All Na'vi people know the story.

934
01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:16.910
Everything is backwards now.

935
01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:18.870
Like out there is the true world

936
01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:21.580
and in here is the dream.

937
01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:45.020
It's hard to believe it's only been three months.

938
01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:50.520
I can barely remember my old life.

939
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:55.900
I don't know who I am anymore.

940
01:31:14.670 --> 01:31:17.510
Haven't gotten lost in the woods, have you?

941
01:31:20.680 --> 01:31:23.600
Your last report was more than two weeks ago.

942
01:31:25.810 --> 01:31:28.310
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!

943
01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:33.440
The way I see it, it's time to terminate the mission.

944
01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:35.360
No, I can do this.

945
01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:37.070
You already have.

946
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:40.240
You give me good, usable intel.

947
01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:42.490
This Tree of Souls place.

948
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:44.830
Yeah, I got them by the balls with that

949
01:31:44.910 --> 01:31:46.330
when this turns into a shit fight,

950
01:31:46.410 --> 01:31:48.160
which it will. Yeah.

951
01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:51.120
Now it's time to come in.

952
01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:54.460
By the way,

953
01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:56.960
you gonna get your legs back.

954
01:31:57.840 --> 01:32:01.470
Yeah. I got your corporate approval. It's a done deal.

955
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:03.970
Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

956
01:32:04.050 --> 01:32:05.850
I'm a man of my word.

957
01:32:08.770 --> 01:32:10.520
I gotta finish this.

958
01:32:12.810 --> 01:32:14.360
There's one more thing.

959
01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:20.030
Ceremony. It's the final stage of becoming a man.

960
01:32:22.530 --> 01:32:24.660
If I do it, I'm one of them.

961
01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:27.950
And they'll trust me.

962
01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:34.790
And I can negotiate the terms of their relocation.

963
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:50.890
Well, then, you'd better get it done, Corporal.

964
01:33:08.330 --> 01:33:12.330
The Na'vi say that every person is born twice.

965
01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:19.750
The second time is when you earn your place among The People forever.

966
01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:29.560
You are now a son of the Omaticaya.

967
01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:34.020
You are part of The People.

968
01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:22.320
Come. Come.

969
01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:42.670
This is a place for prayers to be heard.

970
01:34:44.300 --> 01:34:46.170
And sometimes answered.

971
01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:56.730
We call these trees Utraya Mokri.

972
01:34:57.730 --> 01:34:59.480
The Tree of Voices.

973
01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:03.650
The voices of our ancestors.

974
01:35:18.670 --> 01:35:20.250
I can hear them.

975
01:35:25.170 --> 01:35:26.800
They live, Jake,

976
01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:30.260
within Eywa.

977
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:36.310
You are Omaticaya now.

978
01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:40.140
You may make your bow from the wood of Hometree.

979
01:35:45.650 --> 01:35:47.740
And you may choose a woman.

980
01:35:49.860 --> 01:35:51.820
We have many fine women.

981
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:55.030
Ninat is the best singer.

982
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:59.830
But I don't want Ninat.

983
01:36:04.130 --> 01:36:06.090
Beyral is a good hunter.

984
01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:09.840
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

985
01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:13.680
I've already chosen.

986
01:36:17.180 --> 01:36:19.680
But this woman must also choose me.

987
01:36:23.690 --> 01:36:25.310
She already has.

988
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:21.700
I am with you now, Jake.

989
01:37:23.250 --> 01:37:25.120
We are mated for life.

990
01:37:31.420 --> 01:37:33.470
What the hell are you doing, Jake?

991
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:05.040
Ma Jake!

992
01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:06.420
Don't forget your phase integration.

993
01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:07.830
Jake! No, no, the middle button.

994
01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:09.840
You gotta eat something. Yeah, there you go.

995
01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:23.220
Jake! Jake. Wake up! Jake, please!

996
01:38:23.850 --> 01:38:25.770
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.

997
01:38:25.850 --> 01:38:28.770
Grace, I don't want... Hey!

998
01:38:32.900 --> 01:38:34.030
Jake!

999
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:44.040
Okay.

1000
01:38:55.130 --> 01:38:57.170
Here. I'm done. Let's go.

1001
01:38:57.220 --> 01:38:59.510
And when was the last time you took a shower?

1002
01:38:59.550 --> 01:39:00.600
I don't need a shower.

1003
01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:01.760
Jesus, Marine.

1004
01:39:05.770 --> 01:39:07.060
Jake!

1005
01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:18.780
Jake! Wake up! Jake! Wake up!

1006
01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:23.580
Hey!

1007
01:39:24.290 --> 01:39:26.750
Stop! Stop!

1008
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:27.790
Jake!

1009
01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:29.580
Go back, stop!

1010
01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:35.130
Hey, boss.

1011
01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:36.800
Hey!

1012
01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:40.470
What? I got a native

1013
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:43.510
doing the funky chicken here. He's blocking my blade.

1014
01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.890
Well, keep going. He'll move.

1015
01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:50.060
These people have to learn that we don't stop. Come on, go, go, go.

1016
01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:54.610
Stop! Hey!

1017
01:39:54.690 --> 01:39:56.980
Go! Go!

1018
01:39:57.990 --> 01:39:59.450
There, see? He moved.

1019
01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:11.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1020
01:40:11.790 --> 01:40:13.580
Dude, dude. Whoa, dude! Dude, no!

1021
01:40:13.630 --> 01:40:15.250
Oh! I'm blind.

1022
01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:28.770
Jake!

1023
01:40:28.810 --> 01:40:29.890
Neytiri!

1024
01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:33.150
Here, come on!

1025
01:40:58.050 --> 01:41:00.630
Freeze it right there.

1026
01:41:02.180 --> 01:41:04.680
Scale up. Enhance.

1027
01:41:06.300 --> 01:41:07.850
Son of a bitch.

1028
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:10.810
Unbelievable.

1029
01:41:11.850 --> 01:41:12.890
Get me a pilot.

1030
01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:14.020
Yes, sir.

1031
01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:22.950
Tsu'tey will lead the war party.

1032
01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:30.830
Stop please!

1033
01:41:32.330 --> 01:41:34.460
This will only make it worse.

1034
01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:36.250
You do not speak here!

1035
01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:39.210
We will strike them in the heart.

1036
01:41:47.010 --> 01:41:49.180
Tsu'tey! Don't do this.

1037
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:53.850
You! Listen. Brother...

1038
01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:01.030
You mated with this woman?

1039
01:42:01.230 --> 01:42:02.360
Oh, shit.

1040
01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:05.740
Is this true?

1041
01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:10.450
We are mated before Eywa. It is done.

1042
01:42:11.830 --> 01:42:13.000
Brother, please.

1043
01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:15.250
Do not attack the Sky People.

1044
01:42:15.290 --> 01:42:16.870
Many Omaticaya will die if you do.

1045
01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:18.790
You are not my brother!

1046
01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:24.220
And I am not your enemy!

1047
01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:28.720
The enemy is out there, and they are very powerful!

1048
01:42:30.970 --> 01:42:32.770
Go! Go! Go!

1049
01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:36.940
I can talk to them.

1050
01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:38.440
No more talk.

1051
01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:39.900
Tsu'tey!

1052
01:42:46.110 --> 01:42:49.030
I am Omaticaya. I am one of you.

1053
01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:52.080
And I have the right to speak.

1054
01:42:56.710 --> 01:42:58.580
I have something to say...

1055
01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:02.380
...to all of you.

1056
01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:08.510
The words are like stones in my heart.

1057
01:43:12.850 --> 01:43:14.810
Sir, I'm sorry. No, no, no! Hold on!

1058
01:43:14.930 --> 01:43:17.140
You can't interrupt a link in progress!

1059
01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:19.650
It's very dangerous!

1060
01:43:22.270 --> 01:43:23.440
Grace!

1061
01:43:24.650 --> 01:43:25.860
Oh, no.

1062
01:43:26.070 --> 01:43:27.650
Wait! Stay down, sir.

1063
01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:31.820
Okay. Look...

1064
01:43:32.910 --> 01:43:34.240
I was sent here to...

1065
01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:39.290
You see?

1066
01:43:39.460 --> 01:43:41.920
It is a demon in a false body.

1067
01:44:01.810 --> 01:44:03.310
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

1068
01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:05.190
You crossed the line.

1069
01:44:08.650 --> 01:44:10.820
Wheel this meat out of here.

1070
01:44:12.530 --> 01:44:15.080
Jake! What the hell is going on here?

1071
01:44:18.330 --> 01:44:20.120
You let me down, son.

1072
01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:23.380
So, what,

1073
01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:26.880
you find yourself some local tail

1074
01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:30.130
and you just completely forget what team you're playing for?

1075
01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:32.720
Parker, there is time to salvage the situation.

1076
01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:34.680
Parker... Shut your pie hole!

1077
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:39.600
Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot me?

1078
01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:41.060
I could do that.

1079
01:44:41.140 --> 01:44:42.440
You need to muzzle your dog.

1080
01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:43.810
Yeah, can we just take this down

1081
01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:45.270
a couple of notches, please?

1082
01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:47.860
You say you want to keep your people alive?

1083
01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:49.940
You start by listening to her.

1084
01:44:50.030 --> 01:44:52.320
Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya

1085
01:44:52.410 --> 01:44:54.200
in a way you can't imagine. You know what?

1086
01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:56.580
You throw a stick in the air around here,

1087
01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:59.620
it's gonna land on some sacred fern,

1088
01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:01.080
For Christ's sake! I'm not talking

1089
01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:04.080
about some kind of pagan voodoo here.

1090
01:45:04.130 --> 01:45:05.580
I'm talking about something real,

1091
01:45:05.630 --> 01:45:07.800
something measurable in the biology of the forest.

1092
01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:08.300
Something measurable in the biology of the forest.

1093
01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:09.880
Which is what, exactly?

1094
01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:12.260
What we think we know

1095
01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:15.720
is that there is some kind of electrochemical communication

1096
01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:17.850
between the roots of the trees,

1097
01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:20.180
like the synapses between neurons.

1098
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:24.850
And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth connections to the trees around it.

1099
01:45:24.940 --> 01:45:27.900
And there are ten-to-the-twelfth trees on Pandora.

1100
01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:30.610
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

1101
01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:33.740
It's more connections than the human brain.

1102
01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:37.450
Get it? It's a network.

1103
01:45:37.490 --> 01:45:40.540
It's a global network, and the Na'vi can access it.

1104
01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:44.120
They can upload and download data. Memories.

1105
01:45:44.170 --> 01:45:46.920
At sites like the one you just destroyed.

1106
01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:48.590
Yes!

1107
01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:53.260
What the hell have you people been smoking out there?

1108
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:56.640
They're just goddamn trees!

1109
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:59.760
You need to wake up, Parker.

1110
01:45:59.810 --> 01:46:01.140
No. You need to wake up.

1111
01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:05.690
The wealth of this world isn't in the ground. It's all around us.

1112
01:46:05.770 --> 01:46:09.480
The Na'vi know that, and they are fighting to defend it.

1113
01:46:09.570 --> 01:46:11.980
If you want to share this world with them,

1114
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:13.860
you need to understand them.

1115
01:46:13.950 --> 01:46:18.660
I'd say we understand them just fine, thanks to Jake here.

1116
01:46:20.370 --> 01:46:22.830
Hey, Doc, come take a look.

1117
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:25.160
They're not gonna give up their home.

1118
01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:28.630
They're not gonna make a deal.

1119
01:46:29.670 --> 01:46:32.500
For what? Lite beer?

1120
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:34.090
And blue jeans?

1121
01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:40.220
There's nothing that we have that they want.

1122
01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:45.180
Everything they sent me out here to do is a waste of time.

1123
01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:51.360
They're never gonna leave Hometree.

1124
01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:55.400
So,

1125
01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:00.410
since a deal can't be made, I guess things get real simple.

1126
01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:03.160
Jake, thanks.

1127
01:47:03.290 --> 01:47:07.750
I'm getting all emotional. I might just give you a big wet kiss.

1128
01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:35.190
Talk to me, Lyle.

1129
01:47:35.530 --> 01:47:38.070
It looks like they hit it with banshees first.

1130
01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:39.860
See the angle's steep?

1131
01:47:44.120 --> 01:47:46.120
They set the ampsuit on fire.

1132
01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:47.700
Driver's toast.

1133
01:47:49.210 --> 01:47:50.960
The rest of the squad?

1134
01:47:52.130 --> 01:47:55.050
Six bodies. That's all of them.

1135
01:47:56.510 --> 01:47:57.710
The equipment's totaled.

1136
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:03.010
Jesus Christ.

1137
01:48:06.180 --> 01:48:09.560
I'll do it with minimal casualties to the indigenous.

1138
01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.400
I'll drive them out with gas first.

1139
01:48:14.190 --> 01:48:15.770
It'll be humane.

1140
01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:18.860
More or less.

1141
01:48:20.570 --> 01:48:22.410
All right, let's pull the trigger.

1142
01:48:25.870 --> 01:48:28.250
Come on, people. Let's get it packed, let's go.

1143
01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:31.750
You know, they never even wanted us to succeed.

1144
01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:38.130
They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose to trigger a response.

1145
01:48:38.210 --> 01:48:40.920
Just fabricating this war to get what they want.

1146
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:43.390
This is how it's done.

1147
01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:49.480
When people are sitting on shit that you want,

1148
01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:51.230
you make them your enemy.

1149
01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:53.600
Then you're justified in taking it.

1150
01:48:53.690 --> 01:48:56.980
Quaritch is rolling the gunships. He's gonna hit Hometree.

1151
01:48:57.070 --> 01:48:58.070
My God.

1152
01:49:04.530 --> 01:49:07.660
Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here!

1153
01:49:07.740 --> 01:49:08.740
Back off!

1154
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:12.540
Parker. Wait. Stop. These are people you're about to...

1155
01:49:12.580 --> 01:49:13.710
No. No, no, no, no. I said back off!

1156
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:17.210
They're fly-bitten savages that live in a tree!

1157
01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:18.380
All right? Look around!

1158
01:49:19.050 --> 01:49:22.760
I don't know about you, but I see a lot of trees! They can move!

1159
01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:24.300
Can you guys just please... Yes, sir.

1160
01:49:24.390 --> 01:49:26.930
There are families in there. There are children. Babies.

1161
01:49:26.970 --> 01:49:28.260
Are you gonna kill children?

1162
01:49:28.350 --> 01:49:32.270
You don't want that kind of blood on your hands. Believe me.

1163
01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:34.770
Just let me try to talk them out.

1164
01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:37.060
They trust me.

1165
01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:42.780
Calibrate fast. We're going in, right now.

1166
01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:44.780
Calibrating three and four.

1167
01:49:44.820 --> 01:49:45.860
Run sequence.

1168
01:49:45.950 --> 01:49:47.780
Initiating. Thirty seconds.

1169
01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:53.910
Listen to me. You've got one hour.

1170
01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:56.580
Unless you want your girlfriend in there when the ax comes down,

1171
01:49:56.710 --> 01:49:59.290
you get them to evacuate. One hour.

1172
01:50:05.470 --> 01:50:06.470
Father!

1173
01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:07.680
Mother!

1174
01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:10.930
Eytukan, I have something to say.

1175
01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:12.430
Listen!

1176
01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:14.940
Speak, Jakesully.

1177
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:19.270
A great evil is upon us...

1178
01:50:19.610 --> 01:50:21.480
The Sky People are coming...

1179
01:50:21.730 --> 01:50:24.240
...to destroy Hometree.

1180
01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:28.160
Look, tell them they're gonna be here soon.

1181
01:50:30.700 --> 01:50:33.500
You have to leave, or you're gonna die.

1182
01:50:33.620 --> 01:50:35.500
Are you certain of this?

1183
01:50:39.290 --> 01:50:43.010
Look, they sent me here to learn your ways

1184
01:50:44.170 --> 01:50:47.470
so one day I could bring this message and that you would believe it.

1185
01:50:50.010 --> 01:50:53.640
What are you saying, Jake? You knew this would happen?

1186
01:50:56.850 --> 01:50:57.850
Yes.

1187
01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:00.860
Look, at first it was just orders,

1188
01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:04.690
and then everything changed.

1189
01:51:04.740 --> 01:51:06.530
Okay? I fell in love.

1190
01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:12.490
I fell in love with the forest and with the Omaticaya people.

1191
01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:15.120
And with you.

1192
01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:17.910
I trusted you. With you. With you.

1193
01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.420
I trusted you!

1194
01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:20.830
Trust me now, please.

1195
01:51:28.220 --> 01:51:30.680
You will never be one of The People!

1196
01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:32.550
I shouldn't have... We tried to stop them!

1197
01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:34.560
Neytiri, please! Please.

1198
01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:40.730
Bind them.

1199
01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:43.480
Leave now!

1200
01:51:43.650 --> 01:51:46.990
You have to go. They're coming!

1201
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:03.040
Time on target, one mike.

1202
01:52:03.090 --> 01:52:05.090
Copy. We have a visual.

1203
01:52:05.130 --> 01:52:08.170
Roger that. Stay on heading 030.

1204
01:52:08.260 --> 01:52:09.590
Roger, 030.

1205
01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:24.400
Run to the forest!

1206
01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:25.440
They're coming!

1207
01:52:27.070 --> 01:52:28.650
They will destroy this place.

1208
01:52:28.740 --> 01:52:30.570
Neytiri, you must go now!

1209
01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:36.950
Run to the forest! Run!

1210
01:52:39.330 --> 01:52:40.370
Run! Run!

1211
01:52:40.670 --> 01:52:44.330
Have no fear.

1212
01:53:01.190 --> 01:53:04.350
No! God damn it, run!

1213
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:06.690
Take the ikran...

1214
01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:08.280
...attack from above.

1215
01:53:12.530 --> 01:53:14.450
That is one big damn tree.

1216
01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:26.460
Well, well, well. I'd say diplomacy has failed.

1217
01:53:28.420 --> 01:53:30.510
All right, people, let's get this done!

1218
01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:33.470
I want every gas round you got right in the front door.

1219
01:53:33.590 --> 01:53:35.550
Roger. CS.40's going hot.

1220
01:53:35.930 --> 01:53:37.140
Fire. Firing.

1221
01:53:48.570 --> 01:53:50.610
Bingo. Mighty good shooting, ace.

1222
01:53:58.530 --> 01:54:00.200
Sir, they've opened fire.

1223
01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:03.830
You've got to be kidding me!

1224
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:18.890
These dumb bastards ain't getting the message.

1225
01:54:18.970 --> 01:54:20.680
All right, let's turn up the heat.

1226
01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:21.970
Switch incendiaries!

1227
01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:23.680
Switching incendiaries.

1228
01:54:23.730 --> 01:54:24.850
Fire.

1229
01:54:28.150 --> 01:54:29.230
No!

1230
01:54:42.450 --> 01:54:44.200
Get everyone to the forest.

1231
01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:49.790
And that's how you scatter the roaches.

1232
01:54:53.550 --> 01:54:54.760
Neytiri!

1233
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:05.770
We gotta move! He's gonna blow the columns!

1234
01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:07.850
My God!

1235
01:55:26.410 --> 01:55:28.120
Mo'at! No!

1236
01:55:28.170 --> 01:55:29.790
If you are one of us,

1237
01:55:31.290 --> 01:55:32.630
help us.

1238
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:42.180
All call signs, switch missiles.

1239
01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:44.970
Give me HE's at the base of the west columns.

1240
01:55:46.930 --> 01:55:48.180
This way!

1241
01:55:49.310 --> 01:55:51.190
Rider section, switch missiles.

1242
01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:53.150
- One's good. - Two's rocks up.

1243
01:55:53.230 --> 01:55:54.270
Three's up.

1244
01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:55.860
Yeah, baby, get some!

1245
01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:58.650
Charlie Oscar, Gunrunner standing by.

1246
01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:00.160
Bring it down. Cleared hot.

1247
01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:08.790
Come on, Grace, move!

1248
01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:13.000
Down! Head down!

1249
01:56:15.590 --> 01:56:17.840
Come on, come on! Down!

1250
01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:24.600
- Solid hits. - Solid rocks on target.

1251
01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:25.850
Screw this.

1252
01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:29.100
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1253
01:56:29.190 --> 01:56:30.980
I didn't sign up for this shit!

1254
01:56:40.660 --> 01:56:42.530
Repeat. Ripple fire.

1255
01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:27.620
Go! Go! Go!

1256
01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:03.190
No, no, get back! Back!

1257
01:58:22.210 --> 01:58:24.800
Come on! Come on, move! Move!

1258
01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:13.430
That's good work, people. First round's on me tonight.

1259
01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:15.350
Let's boogie.

1260
01:59:15.770 --> 01:59:18.190
Dragon coming left, heading home.

1261
01:59:18.650 --> 01:59:20.560
Gunrunner coming left.

1262
01:59:20.650 --> 01:59:23.190
Thunder copies. Rider section copies.

1263
01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:31.870
Father!

1264
01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:49.050
Daughter...

1265
01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:53.300
take... my... bow.

1266
01:59:57.430 --> 02:00:01.900
Protect The People.

1267
02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:11.530
Neytiri!

1268
02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:23.330
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1269
02:00:23.420 --> 02:00:25.300
Get away.

1270
02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:27.260
Get away!

1271
02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:30.090
Get away from here!

1272
02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:33.140
Never come back!

1273
02:00:50.820 --> 02:00:51.950
Pull the plug.

1274
02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:54.160
No, you can't do that!

1275
02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:55.580
You can't do that!

1276
02:00:55.620 --> 02:00:57.620
Calm down! Calm down! No! Please!

1277
02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:16.350
I was a warrior who dreamed he could bring peace.

1278
02:01:17.770 --> 02:01:21.640
Sooner or later, though, you always have to wake up.

1279
02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:25.480
Let's go!

1280
02:01:33.780 --> 02:01:34.910
Put him down!

1281
02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:41.500
You murderer!

1282
02:02:28.130 --> 02:02:30.210
What's going on, brother? Long time no see.

1283
02:02:30.300 --> 02:02:31.380
Hey.

1284
02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:35.430
Personally, I don't feel these tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

1285
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:38.340
They get steak? That's bullshit. Let me see that.

1286
02:02:39.890 --> 02:02:42.060
Yeah. You know what that is. Down.

1287
02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:43.520
Trudy!

1288
02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:45.060
All the way down.

1289
02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:49.690
Max!

1290
02:02:59.740 --> 02:03:02.240
Trudy, fire up the ship! Go!

1291
02:03:02.830 --> 02:03:03.910
Here.

1292
02:03:16.010 --> 02:03:17.340
Clear. Come on.

1293
02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:18.470
Here you go.

1294
02:03:34.030 --> 02:03:37.950
Max, stay here. I need someone on the inside I can trust.

1295
02:03:37.990 --> 02:03:39.280
Okay. Go.

1296
02:03:53.090 --> 02:03:54.250
Clear.

1297
02:03:56.220 --> 02:03:57.470
Come on, baby.

1298
02:03:57.510 --> 02:04:00.300
Colonel? Sir? I got a situation here.

1299
02:04:03.930 --> 02:04:06.970
It's Samson 1-6. Unauthorized engine start.

1300
02:04:10.020 --> 02:04:11.310
Three!

1301
02:04:14.150 --> 02:04:15.360
Come on!

1302
02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:18.650
Mask on!

1303
02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:23.070
Gas, gas, gas!

1304
02:04:24.700 --> 02:04:26.740
I'm taking fire! Let's go!

1305
02:04:29.210 --> 02:04:32.080
Grab my hand! Come on, we're in. Let's go!

1306
02:04:33.340 --> 02:04:35.170
Come on, let's go! Let's go, go!

1307
02:04:47.810 --> 02:04:49.140
Colonel!

1308
02:04:55.860 --> 02:04:57.070
Yeah! Yeah!

1309
02:04:57.150 --> 02:04:58.900
All right! Yes!

1310
02:05:02.610 --> 02:05:03.660
Crap.

1311
02:05:03.700 --> 02:05:05.280
Everybody all right back there?

1312
02:05:05.370 --> 02:05:06.870
Oh, yeah, baby!

1313
02:05:06.910 --> 02:05:07.910
Norm, you good?

1314
02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.080
Yeah!

1315
02:05:09.710 --> 02:05:12.040
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

1316
02:05:12.290 --> 02:05:14.080
Grace is hit! What?

1317
02:05:15.210 --> 02:05:16.840
Get the trauma kit. Trauma kit!

1318
02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:18.170
Keep the pressure on, Grace.

1319
02:05:18.210 --> 02:05:19.920
Trauma kit's forward, on the bulkhead.

1320
02:05:20.470 --> 02:05:21.800
Hang on, Grace.

1321
02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:24.970
Doesn't matter. It's fine.

1322
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:29.560
You're good to go.

1323
02:05:29.640 --> 02:05:30.770
Take it up!

1324
02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:33.770
Hold on. I'm pulling pitch.

1325
02:05:38.190 --> 02:05:39.650
You're clear!

1326
02:05:47.580 --> 02:05:50.330
Just keep going north. Get us deep in the mountains.

1327
02:05:50.410 --> 02:05:51.830
Copy that.

1328
02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:00.300
Norm, you all good up there?

1329
02:06:00.380 --> 02:06:02.090
Yep! Still here.

1330
02:06:03.970 --> 02:06:08.220
Well, at least they can't track us up here. Not this far into the Vortex.

1331
02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:10.770
It's strongest at the Tree of Souls, right?

1332
02:06:10.850 --> 02:06:12.350
Yeah.

1333
02:06:12.430 --> 02:06:13.940
Good. 'Cause that's where we're going.

1334
02:06:23.240 --> 02:06:24.400
Ouch.

1335
02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:29.240
You big baby.

1336
02:06:30.580 --> 02:06:32.040
We're moving.

1337
02:06:32.580 --> 02:06:34.620
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

1338
02:06:35.580 --> 02:06:37.750
I'm a scientist, remember?

1339
02:06:38.670 --> 02:06:41.130
I don't believe in fairy tales.

1340
02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:43.880
The People can help you.

1341
02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:45.630
I know it.

1342
02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:49.510
Why would they help us?

1343
02:07:05.530 --> 02:07:08.660
The People say Eywa will provide.

1344
02:07:10.580 --> 02:07:13.290
With no home, no hope,

1345
02:07:14.330 --> 02:07:16.500
there was only one place they could go.

1346
02:07:30.930 --> 02:07:32.140
Link's running.

1347
02:07:32.850 --> 02:07:34.470
What's the plan here, Jake?

1348
02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:35.930
There's no plan.

1349
02:07:36.890 --> 02:07:41.560
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now. He's not gonna let you near that place.

1350
02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:43.940
I gotta try.

1351
02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:48.030
Launching.

1352
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:10.720
Outcast.

1353
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:12.760
Betrayer.

1354
02:08:13.850 --> 02:08:15.010
Alien.

1355
02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:19.270
I was in the place the eye does not see.

1356
02:08:30.450 --> 02:08:34.330
I needed their help, and they needed mine.

1357
02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:37.240
But to ever face them again,

1358
02:08:37.290 --> 02:08:39.580
I was gonna have to take it to a whole new level.

1359
02:08:48.340 --> 02:08:51.680
Sometimes your whole life boils down to one insane move.

1360
02:08:54.430 --> 02:08:56.810
There's something we gotta do.

1361
02:08:56.890 --> 02:08:58.600
You're not gonna like it.

1362
02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:02.520
Yah!

1363
02:09:08.650 --> 02:09:12.450
The way I had it figured, Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky.

1364
02:09:12.530 --> 02:09:14.200
Nothing attacks him.

1365
02:09:14.700 --> 02:09:16.030
Easy, boy.

1366
02:09:16.450 --> 02:09:18.290
So why would he ever look up?

1367
02:09:19.450 --> 02:09:21.080
But that was just a theory.

1368
02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:33.360
Toruk Macto?

1369
02:11:13.190 --> 02:11:14.690
I See you.

1370
02:11:17.780 --> 02:11:19.110
I See you.

1371
02:11:27.420 --> 02:11:29.120
I was afraid, Jake.

1372
02:11:30.540 --> 02:11:32.040
For my people.

1373
02:11:35.090 --> 02:11:36.720
I'm not anymore.

1374
02:11:46.100 --> 02:11:48.440
Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo...

1375
02:11:49.060 --> 02:11:51.110
...I stand before you...

1376
02:11:52.110 --> 02:11:55.280
...ready to serve the Omaticaya people.

1377
02:11:58.240 --> 02:12:02.490
You are Olo'eyktan, and you are a great warrior.

1378
02:12:03.330 --> 02:12:04.490
I can't do this without you.

1379
02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:13.960
Toruk Macto,

1380
02:12:21.800 --> 02:12:23.550
I will fly with you.

1381
02:12:26.810 --> 02:12:28.560
My friend is dying.

1382
02:12:30.940 --> 02:12:32.480
Grace is dying.

1383
02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:36.320
I beg the help of Eywa.

1384
02:12:48.250 --> 02:12:49.370
Look where we are, Grace.

1385
02:12:56.960 --> 02:12:59.340
I need to take some samples.

1386
02:13:22.780 --> 02:13:26.870
The Great Mother may choose to save all that she is

1387
02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:29.540
in this body.

1388
02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:33.500
Is that possible?

1389
02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:38.340
She must pass through the eye of Eywa and return.

1390
02:13:39.590 --> 02:13:41.130
But, Jakesully,

1391
02:13:42.130 --> 02:13:43.380
she is very weak.

1392
02:13:45.220 --> 02:13:48.060
Hang on, Grace. They're gonna fix you up.

1393
02:13:51.230 --> 02:13:53.850
Hear us please, All Mother.

1394
02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:56.730
Eywa, help her.

1395
02:13:57.400 --> 02:13:59.610
Take this spirit into you...

1396
02:14:03.150 --> 02:14:05.410
...and breathe her back to us.

1397
02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:10.870
Let her walk among us...

1398
02:14:13.370 --> 02:14:15.330
...as one of The People.

1399
02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:45.360
Jake.

1400
02:14:47.780 --> 02:14:48.950
Grace.

1401
02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:52.790
I'm with her, Jake.

1402
02:14:54.790 --> 02:14:56.170
She's real!

1403
02:14:59.210 --> 02:15:02.380
Grace? Grace, please. Grace!

1404
02:15:03.550 --> 02:15:05.170
What's happening?

1405
02:15:06.130 --> 02:15:07.800
What's happening?

1406
02:15:12.140 --> 02:15:13.310
Grace!

1407
02:15:14.020 --> 02:15:15.180
Grace!

1408
02:15:17.270 --> 02:15:18.900
What's happening?

1409
02:15:25.150 --> 02:15:26.570
Did it work?

1410
02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:36.330
Her wounds were too great. It was not enough time.

1411
02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:39.170
She is with Eywa now.

1412
02:16:13.540 --> 02:16:16.200
With your permission, I will speak now.

1413
02:16:18.580 --> 02:16:21.040
You would honor me by translating.

1414
02:16:28.130 --> 02:16:30.220
The Sky People have sent us a message

1415
02:16:30.510 --> 02:16:31.930
(TSU'TEY TRANSLATING)

1416
02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:36.140
That they can take whatever they want

1417
02:16:37.930 --> 02:16:39.730
and no one can stop them.

1418
02:16:43.310 --> 02:16:45.110
Well, we will send them a message.

1419
02:16:47.740 --> 02:16:50.070
You ride out as fast as the wind can carry you.

1420
02:16:53.370 --> 02:16:55.740
You tell the other clans to come.

1421
02:16:58.870 --> 02:17:01.370
You tell them Toruk Macto calls to them.

1422
02:17:03.590 --> 02:17:06.380
And you fly now with me!

1423
02:17:07.420 --> 02:17:09.920
My brothers! Sisters!

1424
02:17:11.130 --> 02:17:13.260
And we will show the Sky People

1425
02:17:14.100 --> 02:17:15.970
that they cannot take whatever they want,

1426
02:17:17.470 --> 02:17:18.930
and that this,

1427
02:17:19.640 --> 02:17:20.680
this is our land!

1428
02:17:27.780 --> 02:17:29.230
Yah!

1429
02:17:44.330 --> 02:17:45.750
Yah!

1430
02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:16.320
Yah!

1431
02:18:34.050 --> 02:18:35.550
We rode out to the four winds.

1432
02:18:38.300 --> 02:18:40.720
To the horse clans of the plain.

1433
02:18:43.690 --> 02:18:44.730
Back to the stars!

1434
02:18:44.810 --> 02:18:47.020
To the ikran people of the Eastern Sea.

1435
02:18:47.060 --> 02:18:48.360
For our children's children!

1436
02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:51.020
When Toruk Macto called them, they came.

1437
02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:56.240
Yah!

1438
02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:34.900
Everyone on this base, every one of you,

1439
02:19:34.990 --> 02:19:36.820
is fighting for survival.

1440
02:19:36.900 --> 02:19:38.410
That's a fact!

1441
02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:41.990
There's an aboriginal horde out there massing for an attack.

1442
02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:47.960
Now, these orbital images tell me

1443
02:19:48.370 --> 02:19:51.590
that the hostiles' numbers have gone from a few hundred

1444
02:19:51.630 --> 02:19:54.210
to well over 2,000 in one day.

1445
02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:56.760
And more are pouring in.

1446
02:19:59.220 --> 02:20:02.640
In a week's time, there could be 20,000 of them.

1447
02:20:02.720 --> 02:20:05.060
At that point, they will overrun our perimeter.

1448
02:20:05.100 --> 02:20:07.350
Well, that's not gonna happen!

1449
02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:12.560
Our only security lies in pre-emptive attack.

1450
02:20:12.610 --> 02:20:15.030
We will fight terror with terror.

1451
02:20:19.320 --> 02:20:23.490
Now, the hostiles believe that this mountain stronghold of theirs

1452
02:20:23.580 --> 02:20:25.950
is protected by their...

1453
02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:27.410
Their deity.

1454
02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:30.790
And when we destroy it,

1455
02:20:30.830 --> 02:20:33.210
we will blast a crater in their racial memory so deep

1456
02:20:33.290 --> 02:20:36.800
that they won't come within 1,000 klicks of this place ever again.

1457
02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:39.550
And that, too, is a fact.

1458
02:20:40.680 --> 02:20:42.140
Yeah! Yeah.

1459
02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:54.690
Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization.

1460
02:20:54.770 --> 02:20:56.480
They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.

1461
02:20:56.570 --> 02:20:58.820
They've got these huge pallets of mine explosives.

1462
02:20:58.900 --> 02:21:01.820
It's for some kind of shock-and-awe campaign.

1463
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:03.820
Fricking daisy cutters!

1464
02:21:05.330 --> 02:21:08.160
Quaritch has taken over. He's rolling, and there's no stopping him.

1465
02:21:08.250 --> 02:21:09.250
When?

1466
02:21:09.330 --> 02:21:10.330
0600 tomorrow.

1467
02:21:10.420 --> 02:21:11.750
Max! Max! I gotta go.

1468
02:21:14.170 --> 02:21:15.670
We're screwed!

1469
02:21:17.130 --> 02:21:19.340
And I was hoping for some sort of tactical plan

1470
02:21:19.380 --> 02:21:21.630
that didn't involve martyrdom.

1471
02:21:23.090 --> 02:21:26.470
We're going up against gunships with bows and arrows.

1472
02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:31.520
I have 15 clans out there.

1473
02:21:32.190 --> 02:21:33.650
That's over 2,000 warriors.

1474
02:21:35.820 --> 02:21:37.230
Now, we know these mountains.

1475
02:21:37.320 --> 02:21:40.280
We fly them. You fly them. They don't.

1476
02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:43.160
Their instruments won't work up here.

1477
02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:45.370
Missile tracking won't work.

1478
02:21:45.870 --> 02:21:47.370
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

1479
02:21:47.450 --> 02:21:49.740
If they bring the fight to us,

1480
02:21:49.830 --> 02:21:51.160
then we have the home-field advantage.

1481
02:21:53.580 --> 02:21:55.250
You know he's gonna commit that bomber

1482
02:21:55.330 --> 02:21:56.500
straight to the Tree of Souls.

1483
02:21:57.130 --> 02:21:58.340
Yeah, I know.

1484
02:21:58.380 --> 02:22:00.920
If they get to the Tree of Souls, it's over.

1485
02:22:01.010 --> 02:22:04.220
That's their direct line to Eywa, their ancestors.

1486
02:22:05.010 --> 02:22:07.010
It'll destroy them.

1487
02:22:07.050 --> 02:22:09.510
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

1488
02:22:24.570 --> 02:22:27.570
I'm probably just talking to a tree right now.

1489
02:22:29.990 --> 02:22:34.750
But if you're there, I need to give you a heads-up.

1490
02:22:37.290 --> 02:22:41.710
If Grace is with you, look into her memories.

1491
02:22:42.970 --> 02:22:45.090
See the world we come from.

1492
02:22:46.180 --> 02:22:48.090
There's no green there.

1493
02:22:49.470 --> 02:22:51.470
They killed their Mother.

1494
02:22:52.270 --> 02:22:54.770
And they're gonna do the same here.

1495
02:22:56.400 --> 02:22:58.980
More Sky People are gonna come.

1496
02:22:59.070 --> 02:23:02.110
They're gonna come like a rain that never ends.

1497
02:23:03.400 --> 02:23:05.150
Unless we stop them.

1498
02:23:07.740 --> 02:23:10.830
Look, you chose me for something.

1499
02:23:12.290 --> 02:23:14.160
I will stand and fight.

1500
02:23:15.210 --> 02:23:16.790
You know I will.

1501
02:23:19.290 --> 02:23:21.550
But I need a little help here.

1502
02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:30.720
Our Great Mother does not take sides, Jake.

1503
02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:35.980
She protects only the balance of life.

1504
02:23:47.780 --> 02:23:49.490
It was worth a try.

1505
02:24:20.190 --> 02:24:22.190
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

1506
02:24:22.230 --> 02:24:25.610
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about, man!

1507
02:24:37.710 --> 02:24:41.080
This is Group Leader. We are entering the Flux Vortex.

1508
02:24:41.460 --> 02:24:43.130
Switch to manual flight mode.

1509
02:24:43.210 --> 02:24:45.050
Copy. Manual flight mode.

1510
02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:21.830
This is Papa Dragon.

1511
02:25:21.920 --> 02:25:23.500
I want this mission high and tight.

1512
02:25:23.580 --> 02:25:25.000
I want to be home for dinner.

1513
02:25:32.510 --> 02:25:33.680
Suit Team, go.

1514
02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:36.260
All right, ladies, let's bring the pain!

1515
02:25:46.820 --> 02:25:48.440
Move, move, move!

1516
02:25:54.070 --> 02:25:55.870
Bravo 2-2, move left.

1517
02:25:56.410 --> 02:25:59.830
Bravo 1-1 moving left. Watch flank.

1518
02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:04.620
Watch formation. Keep moving.

1519
02:26:04.670 --> 02:26:05.750
Roger that.

1520
02:26:05.790 --> 02:26:08.210
Charlie 2-2, watch your spacing.

1521
02:26:08.300 --> 02:26:09.630
Copy that. Over.

1522
02:26:09.670 --> 02:26:14.380
Eyes up. Check that overhead. And watch those thermal scans.

1523
02:26:14.970 --> 02:26:18.300
All call signs, Papa has lead, pushing to target.

1524
02:26:18.350 --> 02:26:20.810
Escorts, stay close on my shuttle.

1525
02:26:25.900 --> 02:26:28.440
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

1526
02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:31.990
Gun crews, keep your head on a swivel.

1527
02:26:32.110 --> 02:26:35.030
Make no mistake, people, they're out there.

1528
02:26:36.620 --> 02:26:39.870
All right, people, target in sight. Range, four klicks.

1529
02:26:39.950 --> 02:26:42.160
Valkyrie 1-6, get your payload ready.

1530
02:26:42.330 --> 02:26:43.500
Copy. Prepare to offload.

1531
02:26:43.580 --> 02:26:44.790
Staff Sergeant, stage the weapon.

1532
02:26:45.580 --> 02:26:47.830
Roll it to the ramp! Let's go!

1533
02:26:50.050 --> 02:26:51.170
Hold!

1534
02:26:59.140 --> 02:27:01.180
Charlie 2-2, got big movement.

1535
02:27:01.270 --> 02:27:02.680
Hold position. Hold up, hold up.

1536
02:27:02.770 --> 02:27:04.770
We got movement out there, 500 meters.

1537
02:27:04.850 --> 02:27:06.770
Charlie 2-2, hold position.

1538
02:27:13.030 --> 02:27:15.990
Sir, ground has movement! Fast approaching.

1539
02:27:16.030 --> 02:27:17.530
Charlie Oscar, Rider section.

1540
02:27:17.570 --> 02:27:18.620
Firing line!

1541
02:27:19.030 --> 02:27:21.700
Targets closing. Range, 400 meters.

1542
02:27:22.410 --> 02:27:23.870
Can't you clean it up?

1543
02:27:23.950 --> 02:27:25.160
No, sir. It's the Flux.

1544
02:27:53.440 --> 02:27:54.530
Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole.

1545
02:27:54.570 --> 02:27:56.110
You follow me through.

1546
02:28:37.860 --> 02:28:40.610
All aircraft, weapons free! Weapons free!

1547
02:28:41.740 --> 02:28:42.950
Break right. Come around.

1548
02:28:46.500 --> 02:28:48.000
Light them up!

1549
02:28:55.630 --> 02:28:57.840
Break formation, engage all hostiles.

1550
02:29:05.100 --> 02:29:06.970
Yeah! Get some!

1551
02:29:46.010 --> 02:29:47.810
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

1552
02:29:58.650 --> 02:30:00.440
Jake! Jake! You copy?

1553
02:30:01.110 --> 02:30:03.820
We're falling back! We're getting hammered!

1554
02:30:03.860 --> 02:30:04.860
Copy. Get out of there.

1555
02:30:10.040 --> 02:30:11.410
That's him. Get after him!

1556
02:30:28.390 --> 02:30:29.390
Take him out!

1557
02:30:34.520 --> 02:30:35.560
Oops.

1558
02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:39.190
Light her up!

1559
02:30:48.620 --> 02:30:50.030
Right there!

1560
02:30:50.160 --> 02:30:52.410
You're not the only one with a gun, bitch.

1561
02:30:52.660 --> 02:30:54.330
Keep her in your sights. Purging. Feeding the leak.

1562
02:30:54.420 --> 02:30:55.460
Arming all pods.

1563
02:31:01.170 --> 02:31:02.260
That's it!

1564
02:31:32.950 --> 02:31:34.040
Seyzey!

1565
02:32:37.980 --> 02:32:40.190
Rogue One is hit. I'm going in.

1566
02:32:41.150 --> 02:32:42.560
Sorry, Jake.

1567
02:32:59.580 --> 02:33:00.670
Fire.

1568
02:33:18.730 --> 02:33:21.270
Tsu'tey! Brother, do you read?

1569
02:33:24.060 --> 02:33:25.730
Rogue One, you copy?

1570
02:33:27.730 --> 02:33:28.900
Trudy!

1571
02:33:39.790 --> 02:33:41.120
Time to target, two minutes.

1572
02:33:41.420 --> 02:33:43.830
Valkyrie 1-6, you are cleared and hot.

1573
02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:46.130
Copy, Dragon. We are starting our bomb run.

1574
02:33:51.930 --> 02:33:53.340
Arm number one!

1575
02:33:54.550 --> 02:33:55.930
Number one armed!

1576
02:33:57.180 --> 02:33:58.430
Ma Jake!

1577
02:34:00.310 --> 02:34:01.480
I read you.

1578
02:34:10.610 --> 02:34:11.650
Neytiri!

1579
02:34:11.740 --> 02:34:12.820
Seyzey's dead.

1580
02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:15.700
They are very close. They are many.

1581
02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:18.620
Do not attack.

1582
02:34:19.200 --> 02:34:21.160
Do you read me, Neytiri?

1583
02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:25.040
Do not attack!

1584
02:34:25.380 --> 02:34:28.540
Fall back now. Get out of there! That's an order!

1585
02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:37.850
Neytiri!

1586
02:34:39.930 --> 02:34:41.850
I got movement, I got movement.

1587
02:34:41.930 --> 02:34:43.770
Hold position. Something's coming.

1588
02:34:43.850 --> 02:34:46.100
Bravo 1-1, I got a big seating. Turn screens over.

1589
02:34:46.190 --> 02:34:47.190
We got movement 200 meters.

1590
02:34:47.270 --> 02:34:48.310
Hold your formation.

1591
02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:50.110
Be ready. Watch your flanks.

1592
02:34:55.240 --> 02:34:56.740
Hundred meters and closing fast.

1593
02:35:13.090 --> 02:35:14.920
We gotta get out of here!

1594
02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:23.720
Fall back! Fall back!

1595
02:35:23.770 --> 02:35:24.850
Move! Move! Move!

1596
02:35:24.890 --> 02:35:26.940
Fall back! On the run! On the run!

1597
02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:36.740
Jake, Eywa has heard you.

1598
02:35:43.660 --> 02:35:45.410
Eywa has heard you!

1599
02:35:56.010 --> 02:35:57.380
Come on!

1600
02:36:09.690 --> 02:36:11.520
Fall back! Move! Move!

1601
02:36:36.050 --> 02:36:38.670
Sir! All escorts are down or falling back.

1602
02:36:38.720 --> 02:36:42.890
Let's get this done. Valkyrie 1-6, this is Dragon.

1603
02:36:42.930 --> 02:36:44.640
Press to target.

1604
02:36:44.720 --> 02:36:45.810
Copy. Pressing to target.

1605
02:36:45.890 --> 02:36:47.890
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

1606
02:37:07.750 --> 02:37:10.160
On my mark. Two, one, mark.

1607
02:37:10.250 --> 02:37:12.580
Drop! Drop! Drop! Go, go, go, go!

1608
02:37:12.580 --> 02:37:12.960
Drop! Drop! Drop! Go, go, go, go!

1609
02:37:46.700 --> 02:37:47.870
Brace!

1610
02:38:04.890 --> 02:38:05.890
It's Sully.

1611
02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:21.030
Mask on!

1612
02:38:21.110 --> 02:38:22.240
Breach alarm!

1613
02:41:06.690 --> 02:41:08.360
Come on. Come to papa.

1614
02:41:36.010 --> 02:41:37.810
Give it up, Quaritch!

1615
02:41:40.850 --> 02:41:42.350
It's all over.

1616
02:41:43.610 --> 02:41:45.560
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

1617
02:41:46.150 --> 02:41:48.190
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

1618
02:42:44.540 --> 02:42:45.790
Come on!

1619
02:43:01.640 --> 02:43:05.770
Hey, Sully, how's it feel to betray your own race?

1620
02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:12.610
You think you're one of them?

1621
02:43:13.820 --> 02:43:15.490
Time to wake up.

1622
02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:00.760
Jake?

1623
02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:15.570
Jake.

1624
02:45:33.580 --> 02:45:34.960
Jake.

1625
02:45:50.980 --> 02:45:52.980
Jake! Ma Jake!

1626
02:46:34.650 --> 02:46:35.980
I See you.

1627
02:46:41.570 --> 02:46:42.900
I See you.

1628
02:47:08.010 --> 02:47:09.220
I See you, Brother.

1629
02:47:10.430 --> 02:47:11.640
Are The People safe?

1630
02:47:14.480 --> 02:47:15.600
They're safe.

1631
02:47:22.110 --> 02:47:23.610
I can't...

1632
02:47:24.780 --> 02:47:27.030
I cannot lead The People.

1633
02:47:27.570 --> 02:47:29.910
You must lead them... Jakesully.

1634
02:47:31.290 --> 02:47:33.200
I'm not officer material.

1635
02:47:33.290 --> 02:47:35.040
It is decided.

1636
02:47:38.380 --> 02:47:39.580
Now...

1637
02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:43.210
...do the duty of Olo'eyktan.

1638
02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:49.470
I will not kill you.

1639
02:47:49.510 --> 02:47:51.140
It is the way!

1640
02:47:53.470 --> 02:47:55.060
And it is good.

1641
02:47:57.310 --> 02:47:59.150
I will be remembered.

1642
02:48:01.770 --> 02:48:05.820
I fought... with Toruk Macto!

1643
02:48:08.320 --> 02:48:10.200
And we were brothers.

1644
02:48:11.620 --> 02:48:15.700
And he... was my last shadow.

1645
02:49:02.130 --> 02:49:04.960
The aliens went back to their dying world.

1646
02:49:07.130 --> 02:49:08.590
Only a few

1647
02:49:08.670 --> 02:49:10.050
were chosen to stay.

1648
02:49:22.270 --> 02:49:24.810
The time of great sorrow was ending.

1649
02:49:26.860 --> 02:49:29.280
Toruk Macto was no longer needed.

1650
02:49:41.830 --> 02:49:45.710
Well, I guess this is my last video log.

1651
02:49:47.550 --> 02:49:51.380
'Cause whatever happens tonight, either way, I'm...

1652
02:49:52.390 --> 02:49:55.220
I'm not gonna be coming back to this place.

1653
02:49:58.850 --> 02:50:00.980
Well, I guess I'd better go.

1654
02:50:03.560 --> 02:50:06.610
Yeah, I don't want to be late for my own party.

1655
02:50:09.940 --> 02:50:12.400
Yeah, it's my birthday, after all.

1656
02:50:14.910 --> 02:50:17.240
This is Jake Sully signing off.

1657
02:51:50.920 --> 02:51:52.840
Walking through a dream

1658
02:51:52.920 --> 02:51:56.590
I see you

1659
02:51:56.680 --> 02:52:03.010
My light in darkness breathing hope of new life

1660
02:52:03.100 --> 02:52:07.440
Now I live through you and you through me

1661
02:52:07.520 --> 02:52:09.850
Enchanting

1662
02:52:10.690 --> 02:52:13.900
I pray in my heart

1663
02:52:13.980 --> 02:52:17.950
That this dream never ends

1664
02:52:18.030 --> 02:52:24.870
I see me through your eyes

1665
02:52:26.960 --> 02:52:33.880
Breathing new life, flying high

1666
02:52:35.300 --> 02:52:42.220
Your love shines the way into paradise

1667
02:52:42.260 --> 02:52:46.020
So I offer my life

1668
02:52:46.060 --> 02:52:51.190
I offer my love for you

1669
02:52:51.230 --> 02:52:54.690
And my heart was never open

1670
02:52:54.730 --> 02:52:58.150
And my spirit never free

1671
02:52:58.240 --> 02:53:04.580
To the world that you have shown me

1672
02:53:05.200 --> 02:53:09.410
But my eyes could not envision

1673
02:53:10.370 --> 02:53:17.380
All the colors of love and of life evermore

1674
02:53:19.130 --> 02:53:24.800
Evermore

1675
02:53:26.850 --> 02:53:32.600
I see me through your eyes

1676
02:53:32.650 --> 02:53:36.770
Flying high

1677
02:53:36.940 --> 02:53:43.660
Your love shines the way into paradise

1678
02:53:43.740 --> 02:53:50.660
So I offer my life as a sacrifice

1679
02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:57.460
I live through your love

1680
02:53:58.170 --> 02:54:02.680
I live

1681
02:54:04.010 --> 02:54:08.520
Through your life

1682
02:54:12.810 --> 02:54:18.440
I see you

1683
02:54:19.860 --> 02:54:26.660
I see you
